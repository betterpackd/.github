## About BetterPackD ðŸ‘‹

BetterPackD is an organization for building minimalist and lightweight container images packed with useful tools.

## Principles

1. Images are based on Alpine, Ubuntu or Debian
2. Image size should be as small as possible.
3. Images are build by Github workflows.
4. Images are published on Github or Docker container registry.
5. Before images are published, they are tested automaticly. 
6. Available tags:
   - latest
   - release (with useful namings like release_tool_1.2.3_tool2_1.2.3)
7. Repository contains a list with all available tags (tags.json).
